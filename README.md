WIP

Built with: ReactJs.

Styled with: Sass, using Grids and BEM naming strategy.

=> Version 1 - End Goal <=

> Users can select their level preference (beginner, intermediate, advanced).
> Users take turns discussing various topics in their target language.
> Users get served conversation topics based on their target language.
> Users get helpful hints by way of pompts and vocabulary.
> Users can pause languguage exchange, and skip questions.
> Mobile friendly, and easy to use on a single device for two users.

=> Version 2 - End Goal <=

> Replace static data with a large database of questions (V1 just has dummy data).
> Sign up & authentication.
> The progress of users is tracked, and completed topics saved so no user will get the same question twice.
> Choice for one or both players to play logged in (saving conversation progress for the single player). 
> Integrate redux if needed.
